# idsr

*idsr* is an **R** package for reading data from data bases stored in the IDS format (Alter and Mandemakers, 2014) and creating data in a form suitable for statistical analysis (in **R**).

It is still under development and you use it on your own risk. But please try it and report!

### Installation

Use Hadley Wickham's *devtools*:

```
> install.packages(c("devtools", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readxl"))
> devtools::install_github("goranbrostrom/idsr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

and then

```
> library(idsr)
> episodes <- efc(indi, varset)
```
and read the documentation and vignette.

You may need additional tools, you will be told if something is missing.
